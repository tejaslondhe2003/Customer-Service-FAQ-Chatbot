1. **User Input**: The user submits a question via the web interface.
2. **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot uses NLTK to analyze the input and determine the user's intent.
3. **Response Retrieval**: Based on the recognized intent, the chatbot searches the JSON knowledge base for the corresponding answer.
4. **Output**: The chatbot displays the answer to the user in the chat interface.

This workflow ensures that users receive accurate and relevant information quickly.
